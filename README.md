#Module_14_Challenge

## Assignment
For this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks for an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Description 

app.js:

Initialization: Contains an init function that initializes the dashboard, reads data from samples.json, and populates a dropdown menu with sample IDs.
Chart Updates: Defines an updateCharts function that updates the bar, bubble, and gauge charts based on the selected sample from the dropdown.
Metadata Display: Includes an updateMetadata function that displays demographic information corresponding to the selected sample.
Event Handling: Implements an optionChanged function to handle changes in the dropdown selection and trigger updates to charts and metadata display.

index.html:

Structure: Lays out the HTML structure of the dashboard, defining where charts and metadata will be displayed.
Styling and Frameworks: Includes links to Bootstrap for CSS styling and layout management.
Script References: References external libraries like D3.js for data-driven DOM manipulations, Plotly.js for charting, and the local app.js script, where I built out the JavaScript code.

samples.json:

Data Storage: Holds the dataset in JSON format, which includes sample IDs (names), demographic information (metadata), and sample test results (samples).
Data Format: Organizes the sample test results with OTU IDs, sample values, and labels for creating visualizations.

deployment: 

I deployed the code to a free static page hosting service (offered through GitHub), which made the app accessible online. 

## Credits
For this challenge, I utilized Google, ChatGPT, Stack Overflow, TA assistance, and educational resources related to the unit provided by BCS.
